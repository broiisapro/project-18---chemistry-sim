# Quantum Chemistry Orbital Visualization

This project visualizes atomic orbitals (s, p, d orbitals) using 3D graphics. It leverages Python's scientific libraries like **NumPy** to calculate the orbital functions.

## Features

- Visualizes various orbitals:
  - **s orbital** (spherical symmetry)
  - **p orbital** (dumbbell shape along the x, y, or z axis)
  - **dx2-y2 orbital** (four-lobed shape)
  - **dz2 orbital** (doughnut shape)
  
- Allows interactive 3D rotation of the visualized orbitals.
- Provides different orbital modes for user selection.
- Customizable color schemes for orbital rendering.
